Your data is stolen and encrypted.

If you don't pay the ransom, the data will be published on our TOR darknet sites. Keep in mind that once your data appears on our leak site, it could be bought by your competitors at any second, so don't hesitate for a long time. The sooner you pay the ransom, the sooner your company will be safe.
If you have an external or cloud backup; what happens if you don't agree with us?

All countries have their own PDPL (Personal Data Protection Law) regulations. In the event that you do not agree with us, information pertaining to your companies and the data of your company's customers will be published on the internet, and the respective country's personal data usage authority will be informed. Moreover, confidential data related to your company will be shared with potential competitors through email and social media. You can be sure that you will incur damages far exceeding the amount we are requesting from you should you decide not to agree with us.
Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you.

Seeking their help will only make the situation worse. They will try to prevent you from negotiating with us, because the negotiations will make them look incompetent. After the incident report is handed over to the government department, you will be fined. This will be a huge amount. Read more about the GDPR legislation:

The government uses your fine to reward them. And you will not get anything, and except you and your company, the rest of the people will forget what happened!!!!!
